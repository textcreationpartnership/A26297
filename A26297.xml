            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A LETTER Sent by the GRAND VISIER TO THE Duke of Lorrain, In His CAMP at ZALUOCK, On the Eighteenth of <hi>September,</hi> 1687. In which He earneſtly Entreats for PEACE.</head>

               <salute>CHARLES, <hi>Great Captain, Lord and Commander of the Chriſtian Army,</hi>
               </salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WE with our faithful Services, do let you know, that the Great God for a long time hath punniſhed us for unjuſtly taking up Arms againſt You; Our grievous Loſſes being certain demonſtrations and marks of an angry and provoked Deity, whom by all means We would ſeek to appeaſe, and doubt not by the Righteous and Gracious God from the Chaſtiſement that is now upon Us, will fully ſatisfie and attone his Wrath, and that he will again take us into his Grace and Mercy, and remove Our many Afflictions, and raiſe Our Heads and Hearts, ſo much from the influence of Heaven depreſſed.</p>
            <p>Moſt Noble Duke, conſider the Evils and Diſcommodities of a long War. How fertile Countries are devaſtated, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
<pb facs="tcp:106595:2"/>Cities and Villages conſumed by Rapine and Fire. The number of Mankind deminiſhed, all living Creatures deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Fruits of the Earth trampled under Foot, and Trade and Commere the Sinew of an Empire, wholly loſt and at a ſtand</p>
            <p>Now We with Our whole Hearts, wiſh no other than Love and Peace: So kind and benign to Mankind are its effects, that Kingdoms flouriſh, the People multiply, and the Husband-man after his toil gathers his Fruits with quietneſs.</p>
            <p>In fine, as War deſtroys and overturns all, ſo Love and Peace brings and reſtores every thing to its height and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which with Our whole Heart We court, not in the leaſt doubting to find the ſame good ſentiments and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in your Highneſs, being the only Treaſure and Happineſs of the World.</p>
            <p>Conſidering how without cauſe We began this War, We muſt needs acquieſce and ſay, Our Punniſhment is juſt, and leſs than we deſerve. Yet, We hope Our Humiliation hath appeaſed Our angry Prophet; as Our acknowledgment and condeſcention will Our Conquering Foe; and that at laſt it will enter into Your Highneſſes Heart, and conſideration; the benefits a firm and general Peace would occaſion: Hoping Our endeavours for the ſame will not be fruitleſs, through Your Highneſſes Liking and good Offices.</p>
            <p>But if all this moves not Your Victorious mind, let the conſideration of the vaſt quantity of innocent Blood that was ſpilled the laſt Campaign, which cries to God for Revenge: Leſt as great unhappineſs (as we at preſent feell) return on Your Highneſs, and Chriſtian Allies, for being an Enemy to the preſervation of Mankind.</p>
            <p>Give us therefore, Great Sir, Your ſudden thoughts about this Affair, which ſhall be received with Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>
